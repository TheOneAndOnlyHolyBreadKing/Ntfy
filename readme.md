#  :bread: NTFY DOCKER-COMPOSE
This is my docker-compose I use to deploy my Ntfy with to have better and easier control over it. Make sure to configure the server.yml to enable some other features you would want, like push and email notification.

# WHAT IS NTFY
Ntfy is a command-line tool that simplifies notifications in the terminal. It enables users to receive alerts for various events, such as command completion, file changes, or long-running task completion. By integrating with other commands, Ntfy helps users stay informed about important activities without constantly checking their terminal. Users can customize notifications using different backends like Pushbullet, Slack, or native OS notifications, making it a versatile tool for managing and streamlining terminal-based workflows.
